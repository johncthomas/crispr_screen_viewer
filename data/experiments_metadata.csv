MLC1 knockouts were produced using traditional single cell clones (SCC) or using the anchor induced CRISPR (using SpyoCas9 in this subset of the experiment).",3 separate MCL1 guides were used for the anchor screening samples because the authors were testing the type of guide. Validation of the individual guides is not important to this work and so they were grouped as one sample.,10.1038/s41467-020-14620-6,"DeWeirdt, Peter C., et al.
